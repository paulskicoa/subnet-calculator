	192 to 223 is Class C. Use /24.

		<h4>The number you choose will be rounded up to the nearest 
		power of 2 to ensure there's an equal number of maximum hosts on all subnets. For example, if you select 6,
		you'll get 8 subnets and could choose any 6 of these to use. The remaining subnets would be available if needed at a later date. Remember that the first and last address in each subnet are reserved for the Network ID and Broadcast Address, respectively.</h4>
